I have since childhood loved dogs but this interest was ignited by my beloved dog Nellie whom I adopted from South Korea a few years back.

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Purpose</div>
                    <p>While working at Infor, I took part in a test automation initiative. The goal of the initiative was to achieve 100% coverage of M3 through test automation, thereby making the product more reliable and less susceptible to regression errors. </p>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">In practice</div>
                    <p>One of the scripts I was assigned to write was for a part of the Quality Management process in M3. I started out with a design created by a Business Analyst covering the different scenarios the script was expected to address. From that design, I created my own technical design, mapping the structure of my script. 
                        It was important to identify differences and similarities between the various test scenarios. I analyzed how to best divide the functionality needed into different methods. For me it was essential to create a maintainable structure that was both easy to understand and easy to build upon in the future. 
                        I asked a more senior colleague for a review of my design before I started implementing my code in order to assure good quality. The script was written in Java using TestNG.</p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Purpose</div>
                    <p>During my time at Infor, I have gained extensive experience through various development assignments, including the creation of API transactions. While the ERP-system M3 is designed to be utilized through a user interface, it also offers alternative methods for interaction. 
                        M3 can be accessed from multiple devices, enhancing usability across all processes, such as manufacturing. By leveraging API transactions, information can be transmitted to machines and relayed to the database through product scanning, thereby improving overall operational efficiency.</p>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">In practice</div>
                    <p>All assignments I have undertaken begin with a meeting between the software engineer and the business analyst. The people primarily responsible for ensuring the completion of the development task. As a software engineer, it is essential for me to understand the use case and the objectives of the development. 
                        Throughout the process, I prefer to have regular check-ins to ensure that everything is progressing smoothly, allowing for questions and clarifications as needed.
                        A significant aspect of this work involves understanding how to build the appropriate functionality while adhering to existing code standards. 
                        I have developed transactions for adding, removing, and copying posts in a database, as well as listing results. Generally, this functionality has been previously created for other API transactions; therefore, the challenge lies in adapting it to meet specific requirements. This adaptation can be complex due to varying field constraints and other attributes.</p>

                            Stay critical when working with legacy code. There might be a good reason behind code that seems incorrect at first.

                            Sometimes the solution is not straight forward. Good to try different things and compare the results.
